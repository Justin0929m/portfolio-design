    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Justin Scholtz and web development has been a passion of mine ever since 2016 when I attended an intro to web development at a company called Rlabs, we did a month-long course where we were introduced to HTML and CSS. What made me realize it was my passion was the number of times I could have given up but didn't, I still had that fire in me to succeed in the challenges and become a front-end web developer. My journey consists of me joining a bootcamp and self studying, over my journey I've reached a point where I'm very comfortable with HTML and CSS but I'm still learning the ropes of JavaScript, I would love to then grow my VUE JS skills as my JS framework to broaden my skill set. I now feel like I'm ready to take on the next step in my journey and find employment as front end developer, Life Choices prepared me well for the next stage of my life so I'm ready for anything and everything.</p>
